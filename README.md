# WebBlocker
What we are going to in this program is that we will pass the link of websites which you think is 
distracting and the time that you are working on your computer and program will block those website.

# Intro
By using this program you can block the websites you want at any time.

Just need to set the websites in a file called "data.txt" and save it next to the script. The script will
read the domain names and will block them at the time you set.

Very simple and very useful, Enjoy.


# Warning
This program easily blocks any website you want, but be sure not to delete the "backup" file that creates
by the program.

Cause when we want to block the websites we make some changes to your system and for reseting everything
back to its normal we use the "backup" file.

For reseting the program just use following code:

```

python3 script.py RESET

```
